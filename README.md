# PID Control, Explained

An educational web application for learning PID (Proportional-Integral-Derivative) control through interactive visualization and hands-on experimentation.

**[Live Demo](https://ferrolho.github.io/pid-control-explained/)**

## Overview

PID control is fundamental to robotics, automation, and control systems. This demo helps you build intuitive understanding through interactive visualization rather than just equations and theory.

### System Model

A 1D cart slides along a bounded rail (0–100). The controller applies a single scalar **force** to the cart — this is the only control input. The cart obeys Newton's second law (`F = ma`) with viscous friction and optional gravity (tilted rail). The goal is to drive the cart's position to a desired target.

|                   | Description                                                    |
| ----------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **State**         | Position, velocity                                             |
| **Control input** | Force ∈ [-100, 100]                                            |
| **Parameters**    | Mass (inertia), friction (viscous damping), gravity (constant) |
| **Disturbances**  | Impulse forces that decay over time                            |

### Learning Objectives

- Understand what each PID term (P, I, D) does and when it's needed
- Develop intuition for tuning trade-offs (speed vs stability vs accuracy)
- Recognize common control behaviors: overshoot, oscillation, steady-state error
- Experiment with different scenarios to build mental models

## Features

### Interactive Visualization
- Real-time 1D cart simulation with physics (mass, friction, disturbances)
- Live graphs showing position, error, and PID term contributions
- Motion trails to visualize behavior

### Educational Content
- Clickable equation terms with detailed explanations
- Side panel with comprehensive learning materials covering:
  - Core concepts (feedback control, error signals, overshoot, etc.)
  - Detailed PID term explanations with physical intuitions
  - Advanced topics (integral windup, derivative kick, tuning methods)

### Preset Scenarios
Demonstrate key control concepts:
- **Well-tuned**: Fast response (~1s rise), moderate overshoot (~19%), settles within ~7s
- **Too much P**: Large overshoot (~55%) and sustained oscillation (~11 crossings)
- **No damping**: Oscillation without D term (~67% overshoot, ~9 crossings)
- **P-only (tilted rail)**: Steady-state error from constant force — needs I term to fix
- **Aggressive D**: Sluggish, overly cautious response (~4s rise, ~2% overshoot)

### Interactive Controls
- Adjust PID gains (Kp, Ki, Kd) with live updates
- Manual target positioning via slider or canvas click
- Auto-step mode: automatic alternating setpoints for systematic observation
- Add disturbances to test controller robustness

### Performance Metrics
Real-time display of:
- Rise time
- Settling time
- Overshoot percentage
- Steady-state error

## The PID Algorithm

The PID controller generates a control signal based on three terms:

```
u(t) = Kp·e(t) + Ki·∫e(t)dt + Kd·de(t)/dt
```

Where:
- **u(t)** = control signal (force applied to cart)
- **e(t)** = error signal (target - actual position)
- **Kp** = proportional gain
- **Ki** = integral gain
- **Kd** = derivative gain

### Physical Intuitions

- **P term (Kp·e)**: Acts like a **spring** pulling toward the target. Larger error = stronger pull.
- **I term (Ki·∫e·dt)**: Acts like a **bucket filling with water**. Accumulates past errors to eliminate steady-state offset.
- **D term (Kd·de/dt)**: Acts like a **shock absorber**. Provides damping to prevent overshoot.

## How to Use

### Basic Exploration
1. Watch the cart track the target position
2. Drag the target slider or click on the canvas to set a new target
3. Observe how the cart responds

### Experimenting with Gains
1. Try the preset scenarios to see different behaviors
2. Adjust individual gains (Kp, Ki, Kd) to see their effects:
   - **Increase Kp**: Faster response, but more overshoot/oscillation
   - **Increase Ki**: Eliminates steady-state error, but can cause sluggishness
   - **Increase Kd**: Reduces overshoot, dampens oscillations, but can slow response

### Learning with Side Panel
1. Click on terms in the equation (Kp, Ki, Kd, e(t), etc.)
2. Explore three content categories:
   - **Concepts**: Fundamental control theory ideas
   - **PID Terms**: Detailed P, I, D explanations
   - **Advanced**: Integral windup, derivative kick, tuning methods

### Testing Disturbance Rejection
1. Click "Add Disturbance" to apply an impulse force
2. Watch how the controller compensates
3. Try with different gain settings to see effect on disturbance rejection

### Auto-Step Mode
1. Enable "Auto-step mode" checkbox
2. System automatically alternates between positions every 5 seconds
3. Useful for comparing different tuning configurations

## Technical Implementation

### Controller Features
- **Integral anti-windup**: Clamps accumulated integral to prevent windup
- **Derivative on measurement**: Avoids "derivative kick" on setpoint changes
- **Output saturation**: Limits control signal to realistic actuator constraints

### Performance
- Runs at 60 FPS with Euler integration (dt = 0.0167s)
- Graphs show last 10 seconds of data (600 points)
- Responsive design works on desktop, tablet, and mobile

**Tip**: Start with the "Well-tuned" preset, then try "Too much P" to see what happens when gains are poorly chosen. Use the side panel to understand *why* each behavior occurs!
