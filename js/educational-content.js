                <p>Feedback control (closed-loop control) continuously measures the system output and compares it to the desired setpoint. The difference (error) is used to adjust the control signal.</p>

                <h3>Why Feedback Matters</h3>
                <p>Without feedback (open-loop control), the system has no way to know if it's achieving the desired result. External disturbances, friction, or modeling errors will cause the system to miss the target.</p>

                <p>With feedback, the controller automatically compensates for these issues by measuring the actual output and adjusting accordingly.</p>

                <h3>Example in This Demo</h3>
                <p>The cart's position is continuously measured and compared to the target. The PID controller uses this error to generate the control force that pushes the cart toward the target.</p>

                <p>In this demo, the error is the difference between the target position and the cart's actual position.</p>

                <p>Overshoot occurs when the system moves past the target before settling. It's measured as the percentage by which the peak value exceeds the setpoint.</p>

                <h3>What Causes Overshoot?</h3>
                <ul>

                    <li>Decrease K<sub>p</sub> (slower response, but less overshoot)</li>

            content: `
                <p>Oscillation occurs when the system repeatedly overshoots the target in both directions, creating a wave-like motion.</p>

                <h3>Causes of Oscillation</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Excessive P gain:</strong> Too aggressive proportional action</li>
                    <li><strong>Insufficient damping:</strong> Not enough D term to slow down</li>

            content: `
                <p>Settling time is the time it takes for the system to reach the target and stay within a small tolerance band. Here the band is ±2% of the step size around the target (shaded on the position plot), and the cart has to stay in it for a full second to count as settled.</p>

                <h3>What Affects Settling Time?</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>P gain:</strong> Higher K<sub>p</sub> = faster initial response, but may oscillate longer</li>

                </ul>

                <h3>Trade-offs</h3>

            content: `
                <p>Steady-state error is the difference between the target and actual position after the system has "settled" (stopped moving significantly).</p>

                <h3>What Causes It?</h3>
                <p>A constant force — gravity on a tilted rail, a steady wind, a load — can stop the system short of the target. (The friction in this demo is viscous: it only acts while the cart moves, so on its own it causes no steady-state error.) P and D can't remove this offset because:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>P term:</strong> It only pushes in proportion to the error, so it settles where K<sub>p</sub>·e exactly balances the constant force — at a non-zero error</li>
                    <li><strong>D term:</strong> When velocity is zero, D term is zero → provides no help</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>The Solution: Integral Term</h3>
                <p>The I term accumulates error over time. Even a small steady-state error keeps building the integral until it supplies the whole constant force by itself, and the error goes to zero.</p>

                <h3>Try It</h3>
                <p>Compare <strong>Tilted rail, no I</strong> with <strong>Tilted rail, with I</strong>. They differ only in K<sub>i</sub>: the first stops short of the target, the second gets there.</p>

                <p>Rise time measures how quickly the system initially responds when given a new target. It's typically measured as the time to go from 10% to 90% of the setpoint change.</p>

                <h3>What Controls Rise Time?</h3>
                <p>Primarily the <strong>proportional gain</strong> (K<sub>p</sub>). Higher K<sub>p</sub> means stronger force when error is large, leading to faster initial movement.</p>

                <h3>The Trade-off</h3>
                <p>Faster rise time (high K<sub>p</sub>) often comes with:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>More overshoot</li>

                <h3>Physical Intuition: Spring</h3>
                <p>Think of the P term as a <strong>spring</strong> connecting the cart to the target. The farther away from target, the stronger the pull. As the cart approaches the target, the force decreases.</p>

                <h3>Limitations</h3>

                </ul>

                <h3>Physical Intuition: Bucket Filling</h3>
                <p>Imagine a <strong>bucket slowly filling with water</strong>. Each moment of error adds more water. When the bucket is full enough, it tips over and provides the extra force needed to cancel a constant disturbance, like the tilt of the rail.</p>

                <h3>Why It's Needed</h3>
                <p>The I term is the <strong>only way to eliminate steady-state error</strong>. When a constant force prevents the system from reaching the target, the integral term keeps building until it generates enough force to overcome the resistance.</p>

                <h3>Effect of K<sub>i</sub></h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Higher K<sub>i</sub>:</strong> Faster elimination of steady-state error, but can cause overshoot and sluggish response</li>

                <p>Think of the D term as a <strong>shock absorber or damper</strong>. When the cart is moving quickly toward the target, the D term applies a braking force to slow it down and prevent overshoot.</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Reduces overshoot by slowing approach</li>
                    <li>Dampens oscillations</li>

                    <li>Allows higher P gain without instability</li>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Higher K<sub>d</sub>:</strong> More damping → less overshoot, but can make response sluggish</li>
                    <li><strong>Lower K<sub>d</sub>:</strong> Less damping → faster but more oscillation</li>
                    <li><strong>K<sub>d</sub> = 0:</strong> No damping, likely to oscillate</li>

                <h3>How It Works</h3>
                <p>When the cart is:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Approaching target quickly:</strong> D term generates opposing force to slow down</li>
                    <li><strong>Moving away from target:</strong> D term generates force to stop the movement</li>
                    <li><strong>Stationary:</strong> D term is zero</li>

                <h3>Implementation Note</h3>
                <p>This demo uses "derivative on measurement" rather than "derivative on error" to avoid "derivative kick" when the setpoint changes suddenly.</p>

                <h3>Try It</h3>
                <p>Load <strong>P only</strong> (K<sub>d</sub> = 0) to see the oscillation, then slowly raise K<sub>d</sub> and watch it die out. Push it too far and you get <strong>Too much D</strong>: no overshoot, but a slow crawl.</p>

                <p>This demo uses <strong>conditional integration</strong>: while the output is saturated, the integral stops accumulating whenever that would push the output further into saturation. It keeps integrating when that helps pull the output back out.</p>

                <h3>Try It</h3>
                <p>Load <strong>Integral windup</strong> (anti-windup off) and watch the I term grow while the force is pinned at its limit, then overshoot. Switch <strong>Anti-windup</strong> on and replay the step.</p>

                <h3>Real-World Impact</h3>
                <p>Windup is especially problematic in systems with:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Actuator limits (motors have max speed/torque)</li>
                    <li>Large setpoint changes</li>
                    <li>Long periods of sustained error</li>
                </ul>

            shortDesc: 'Sudden D term spike on setpoint change',
            content: `
                <p>Derivative kick is a sudden spike in the derivative term that occurs when the setpoint changes abruptly.</p>

                <h3>Why It Happens</h3>
                <p>If we calculate the derivative as d(error)/dt, and the setpoint suddenly jumps, the error also jumps suddenly. This creates a large derivative spike even though the system hasn't moved yet.</p>

                <div class="formula">d(error)/dt = d(setpoint - measurement)/dt</div>

                <p>When setpoint jumps, d(setpoint)/dt is very large → derivative kick.</p>

                <h3>Solution: Derivative on Measurement</h3>
                <p>This demo uses "derivative on measurement" instead:</p>

                <div class="formula">D = -K<sub>d</sub> × d(measurement)/dt</div>

                <p>Now the derivative term only reacts to changes in the actual system state, not setpoint changes. The negative sign is because we want to oppose motion.</p>

                <h3>Trade-off</h3>
                <p>This approach eliminates derivative kick but also means the D term doesn't help with the initial response to a setpoint change (only with slowing down the approach).</p>

            shortDesc: 'Systematic approaches to finding gains',
            content: `
                <p>Finding good PID gains is more art than science, but several systematic methods exist.</p>

                <h3>Manual Tuning (What You're Doing Now!)</h3>
                <p>A good starting approach:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Set K<sub>i</sub> = 0 and K<sub>d</sub> = 0</li>
                    <li>Increase K<sub>p</sub> until system oscillates</li>
                    <li>Reduce K<sub>p</sub> to about half that value</li>
                    <li>Increase K<sub>d</sub> to reduce overshoot</li>
                    <li>Increase K<sub>i</sub> to eliminate steady-state error</li>
                </ol>

                <h3>Ziegler-Nichols Method</h3>
                <p>A classical tuning method:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Find "ultimate gain" K<sub>u</sub>: K<sub>p</sub> value that causes sustained oscillation</li>
                    <li>Measure oscillation period T<sub>u</sub></li>
                    <li>Use formulas: K<sub>p</sub>=0.6×K<sub>u</sub>, K<sub>i</sub>=2K<sub>p</sub>/T<sub>u</sub>, K<sub>d</sub>=K<sub>p</sub>×T<sub>u</sub>/8</li>
                </ol>

                <p>This often gives aggressive tuning that needs adjustment.</p>

                <h3>Software Auto-Tuning</h3>
                <p>Modern controllers often include auto-tuning algorithms that automatically find good gains by exciting the system and analyzing its response.</p>

                <h3>The Trade-offs</h3>
                <p>There's no single "perfect" tuning. You must balance:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Speed:</strong> How fast to reach target (rise time)</li>
                    <li><strong>Stability:</strong> Overshoot and oscillation</li>
                    <li><strong>Accuracy:</strong> Steady-state error</li>
                </ul>

                <p>Different applications prioritize these differently.</p>

        'control-saturation': {
            title: 'Control Saturation',
            category: 'Advanced',
            shortDesc: 'Actuator limits affect behavior',
            content: `
                <p>Real actuators have physical limits. Motors have maximum speed and torque. Heaters have maximum power. When the PID controller demands more than the actuator can provide, we have saturation.</p>

                <h3>Effects of Saturation</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Slower response:</strong> Can't apply full desired force</li>
                    <li><strong>Integral windup:</strong> I term keeps accumulating during saturation</li>
                    <li><strong>Nonlinear behavior:</strong> System behaves differently when saturated</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>In This Demo</h3>
                <p>The control output is clamped to ±100 units. When the error is very large, the controller "wants" to apply more force but is limited by this saturation.</p>

                <h3>Design Considerations</h3>
                <p>When designing a control system:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Size actuators appropriately for expected loads</li>
                    <li>Implement anti-windup to handle saturation gracefully</li>
                    <li>Consider saturation in performance expectations</li>

            content: `
                <p>Real-world controllers are digital: they read sensors and compute control outputs at discrete time intervals (the sample time, dt).</p>

                <h3>In This Demo</h3>
                <p>The controller here runs at 100 Hz (dt = 0.01 s) and holds its output between updates, like a real digital controller. The physics is integrated ten times finer, at 1 kHz, and both run on a fixed clock — independent of your screen's refresh rate.</p>

                <h3>Why Sample Time Matters</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Integral term:</strong> Accumulates as ∫e(t)dt ≈ Σe×dt (sum depends on dt)</li>
                    <li><strong>Derivative term:</strong> Calculated as Δe/dt (difference depends on dt)</li>
                    <li><strong>Stability:</strong> Too slow sampling can miss fast dynamics</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Rule of Thumb</h3>
                <p>Sample at least 10× faster than the system's natural response time. For this cart demo, the system settles in a few seconds, so 100 Hz is more than adequate.</p>

                <h3>Practical Considerations</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Faster sampling → more CPU load</li>
                    <li>Sensor noise can be problematic with very fast sampling (especially for D term)</li>
                    <li>Gains tuned for one sample time won't work exactly at a different rate</li>
